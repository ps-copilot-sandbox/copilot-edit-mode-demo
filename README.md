In this tutorial, you will learn how to leverage the GitHub Copilot feature called "Edit mode" to enhance your coding experience. Introduced with the release of Visual Studio 2022 version 17.13 and later, Copilot Edit is designed to help iterating across multiple-files more efficient.

- GitHub Copilot extension installed
- GitHub Copilot license

## Introduction

**GitHub Copilot Edit** mode is a powerful feature that allows you to edit code across multiple files in your project. However, the caveat is that, with Copilot being generative in nature, it can generate different results each time you invoke it. This gives quite a challenge for someone who is writing a step-by-step tutorial, as the results may not be consistent. To mitigate this, will focus on the high level concepts and provide a few examples to illustrate the functionality of Copilot Edit mode. The biggest takeway for this tutorial is to understand how to use the Copilot Edit mode effectively, rather than focusing on what you really build with it through this tutorial.

> **Note:** Focus on the high level concepts and how to use the Copilot Edit mode effectively, rather than focusing on what you really build with it through this tutorial. The examples provided are just to illustrate the functionality of Copilot Edit mode.

One way to think about GitHub Copilot is like a football. You still have a control, but it can bounce in a different way.

For example, if I ask a question about `how to create a stock application`, I can get very different results based on when I try it.

For a practioner, this is not bad but maybe even great! However, for someone who is writing a step-by-step tutorial, this can be a challenge. The results may not be consistent and it can be hard to follow along.

Thus, please remind yourself that the goal of this tutorial is to understand how to use the Copilot Edit mode effectively, rather than focusing on what you really build with it through this tutorial. The examples provided are just to illustrate the functionality of Copilot Edit mode.

Now, let's get started with the tutorial!
